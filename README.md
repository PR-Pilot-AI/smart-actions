# Smart Github Actions

This project contains easy-to-use, customizable Github Actions that you can use to automate your project in powerful ways.

## What is a Smart Action?

A smart action is a Github Action that incorporates AI capabilities to automate complex workflows in your projects. These actions can range from simple tasks like labeling issues based on their content, to more complex operations like auto-generating code reviews or managing pull requests.

## Using Smart Actions in Your Projects

To use a smart action in your project, follow these steps:

1. Browse the available smart actions in the `PR-Pilot-AI/smart-actions` repository.
2. Select the action you want to use and copy its workflow file into your project's `.github/workflows` directory.
3. Customize the action's inputs according to your project's needs by editing the workflow file.
4. Commit the changes to your repository. The action will run according to the triggers defined in the workflow file.

## Creating Custom Smart Actions

If you have specific needs that aren't met by the existing smart actions, you can create your own by:

1. Forking the `PR-Pilot-AI/smart-actions` repository.
2. Creating a new workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your fork.
3. Defining your custom action using the Github Actions syntax and incorporating any AI capabilities as needed.
4. Testing the action in your own projects by referencing your fork in the workflow file.

For more detailed instructions on creating and using Github Actions, refer to the [Github Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
