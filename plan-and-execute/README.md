# Plan and Execute Action

The `Plan and Execute` action is designed to enhance your workflow by allowing you to define a task description and expected result within your action inputs. This action operates in two phases: planning and execution. During the planning phase, it creates a plan based on the task description. In the execution phase, it uses the generated plan to achieve the expected result.

## Workflow Ideas

- **Automate Task Planning** Use the action to automatically plan tasks based on descriptions.
- **Execute Plans** Automatically execute plans based on the generated plan and monitor the execution.

## Usage

To use the `Plan and Execute` action in your project, you'll need to include it in your GitHub workflow files. Define the task description and expected result, and configure the action to perform the planning and execution phases.

### Inputs

- `task-description`: (Required) The description of the task to plan.
- `expected-result`: (Required) The expected result of the execution phase.

### Example Workflow
